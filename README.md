# Image Processor App
This application was created for an assignment in which I was tasked with creating an experience that allows a user to modify a photo using image processing techniques. I used openFrameworks and the [ofxImGui](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui) and [ofxMSAInteractiveObject](https://github.com/memo/ofxMSAInteractiveObject/tree/master) addons.

I created an application that has several features:

<ul>
	<li>Brightness, contrast, saturation and RGB color balance controls</li>
	<li>Kernel filters such as bevel, sharpen, blur </li>
	<li>Color filters such as sepia, grayscale, inversion</li>
	<li>Eyedropper tool with a magnifying window to precisely pick a color from the photo</li>
	<li>Drawing with a variable brush size and color selection</li>
	<li>File input and output - open and save your creations</li>
	<li>Drag and drop images into your canvas</li>
</ul>
